                2048 is an easy and fun puzzle game. Even if you don't love numbers you will love this game. It is
                played on a 4x4 grid using W, A, S, D keys or arrow keys for up, left, down and right. Every time you
                press a key -
                all tiles slide. Tiles with the same value that bump into one-another are merged. Although there
                might be an optimal strategy to play, there is always some level of chance. If you beat the game and
                would like to master it, try to finish with a smaller score. That would mean that you finished with
                less moves.
